<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of the study was to describe the novel use of bicalutamide in transgender youth.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a retrospective review of patients with gender dysphoria followed in the pediatric endocrine clinic at Riley Hospital for Children.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 104 patients with gender dysphoria, 23 male-to-female adolescents received bicalutamide 50&nbsp;mg daily as a second-line puberty blocker after insurance company denial of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog. Six patients received estrogen concurrently. Of 13 patients treated exclusively with bicalutamide seen in follow-up, 84.6% had breast development within 6&nbsp;months, the majority being ≥ Tanner stage III.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Bicalutamide may be an alternative to gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs in transgender male-to-female youth who are also ready to undergo physical transition.</p>
