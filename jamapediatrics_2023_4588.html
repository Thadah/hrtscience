<h2><strong>Importance</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Bone mineral density (BMD) <i>z</i> scores in transgender adolescents decrease during puberty suppression with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist. Previous research found that after short-term use of gender-affirming hormones (GAH), pretreatment <i>z</i> scores were not restored. Long-term follow-up studies are lacking.</p>
<h2><strong>Objective</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>To assess BMD after long-term GAH treatment in transgender adults who used puberty suppression in adolescence.</p>
<h2><strong>Design, Setting, and Participants</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>This single-center cohort study with follow-up duration of 15 years selected participants from a database containing all people visiting a gender identity clinic at an academic hospital in the Netherlands between 1972 and December 31, 2018. Recruitment occurred from March 1, 2020, to August 31, 2021. A total of 75 participants diagnosed with gender dysphoria who had used puberty suppression before age 18 years prior to receiving at least 9 years of long-term GAH were included.</p>
<h2><strong>Exposures</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Puberty suppression with a GnRH agonist followed by GAH treatment.</p>
<h2><strong>Main Outcomes and Measures</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck BMD and <i>z</i> scores before the start of puberty suppression, at start of GAH, and at short- and long-term follow-up.</p>
<h2><strong>Results</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Among 75 participants, 25 were assigned male at birth, and 50 were assigned female at birth. At long-term follow-up, the median (IQR) age was 28.2 (27.0-30.8) years in participants assigned male at birth and 28.2 (26.6-30.6) years in participants assigned female at birth. The median (IQR) duration of GAH treatment was 11.6 (10.1-14.7) years among those assigned male at birth and 11.9 (10.2-13.8) years among those assigned female at birth. The <i>z</i> scores decreased during puberty suppression. In individuals assigned male at birth, the mean (SD) <i>z</i> score after long-term GAH use was −1.34 (1.16; change from start of GnRH agonist: −0.87; 95% CI, −1.15 to −0.59) at the lumbar spine, −0.66 (0.75; change from start of GnRH agonist: −0.12; 95% CI, −0.31 to 0.07) at the total hip, and −0.54 (0.84; change from start of GnRH agonist: 0.01; 95% CI, −0.20 to 0.22) at the femoral neck. In individuals assigned female at birth, after long-term GAH use, the mean (SD) <i>z</i> score was 0.20 (1.05; change from start of GnRH agonist: 0.09; 95% CI, −0.09 to 0.27) at the lumbar spine, 0.07 (0.91; change from start of GnRH agonist: 0.10; 95% CI, −0.06 to 0.26) at the total hip, and −0.19 (0.94; change from start of GnRH agonist: −0.20; 95% CI, −0.26 to 0.06) at the femoral neck.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusions and Relevance</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In this cohort study, after long-term use of GAH, <i>z</i> scores in individuals treated with puberty suppression caught up with pretreatment levels, except for the lumbar spine in participants assigned male at birth, which might have been due to low estradiol concentrations. These findings suggest that treatment with GnRH agonists followed by long-term GAH is safe with regard to bone health in transgender persons receiving testosterone, but bone health in transgender persons receiving estrogen requires extra attention and further study. Estrogen treatment should be optimized and lifestyle counseling provided to maximize bone development in individuals assigned male at birth.</p>
