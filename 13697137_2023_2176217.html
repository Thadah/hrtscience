<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gender affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) is used by many transgender people to reduce gender incongruence and improve psychological functioning. As GAHT shares many similarities with menopausal hormone therapy, clinicians supporting people through menopause are ideally placed to manage GAHT. This narrative review provides an overview of transgender health and discusses long-term effects of GAHT to consider when managing transgender individuals across the lifespan. Menopause is less relevant for transgender individuals who take GAHT (often given lifelong) to achieve sex steroid concentrations generally in the range of the affirmed gender. For people using feminizing hormone therapy, there is an elevated risk of venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroke and osteoporosis relative to cisgender individuals. For trans people using masculinizing hormone therapy, there is an increased risk of polycythemia, probable higher risk of myocardial infarction and pelvic pain which is poorly understood. Proactive mitigation of cardiovascular risk factors is important for all transgender people and optimization of bone health is important for those using feminizing hormones. With a lack of research to guide GAHT in older age, a shared decision-making approach is recommended for the provision of GAHT to achieve individual goals whilst minimizing potential adverse effects.</p>
