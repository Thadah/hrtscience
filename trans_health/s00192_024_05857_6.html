<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The current study sought to evaluate the sexual function of transgender men and women and to identify associated factors.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Trans individuals who were outpatients at our gender incongruence (GI) center for follow-up of gender-affirming hormone therapy with age ranging 27 to 50 years were invited to participate in this cross-sectional study. Clinical data were collected from the medical records. Two scales, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Male Sexual Function Index (MSFI), were administered to all females (<i>n</i> = 50) and all males (<i>n</i> = 58). Each participant also responded to a semi-structured questionnaire that assessed feelings regarding being transgender and satisfaction with sexual life.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Relative to trans women, trans men had a higher total FSFI score, and higher scores in the FSFI domains of arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), and in the total MSFI score, and higher scores in the MFSI domains of arousal, erection, orgasm, and satisfaction (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). A separate semi-structured evaluation indicated that more than half of the trans men and almost half of the trans women were satisfied or very satisfied with their sexual life.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The total scores from the FSFI and MSFI indicated a high risk of sexual dysfunction in trans men and especially, in trans women. However, the semi-structured evaluation showed that more than half of the trans men and almost half of the trans women were satisfied with their sexual life.</p>
