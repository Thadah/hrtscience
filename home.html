<h1>Welcome to HRT Science!</h1>
<p>This page aims to be a resource to archive and index available factual information about all forms of Gender-affirming Hormone Therapy (GAHT).&nbsp;</p>
<p>GAHT is medical treatment that uses hormones to help bring a personâ€™s physical characteristics more in line with their gender identity. The objective of this therapy is to reduce gender disphoria in individuals that suffer it. Depending on each person's goals, the medications used can vary:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Transfeminine</strong>: Sex hormones such as estrogen are generally used, be it in monotherapy form, or by combining them with an anti-androgen such as Spironolactone, Cyproterone Acetate, Bicalutamide or a GnRH Antagonist. The objective is to promote secondary sex characteristics such as breast growth, skin softening, reduction in facial and body hair, and redistribution of fat towards a more feminine pattern.</li>
  <li><strong>Transmasculine</strong>: Testosterone is used, with the objective of deepening the voice, increasing facial and body hair, shift fat towards a more masculine distribution, build muscle mass and halt menstruation.</li>
  <li><strong>Transneutral: </strong>These regimes are usually customized, varying in what wants to be achieved:<ul>
      <li><u>Feminization</u>: While low-dose estrogens combined with anti-androgens are an option, Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) are also a popular choice for many individuals, because they bind to estrogen receptors, but act as an agonist (activator) or antagonist (blocker) in others, which results in achieving more feminine traits without breast growth. Some examples of these medications are Raloxifen, Tamoxifen and Bazedoxifene.</li>
      <li><u>Masculinization</u>: low-dose testosterone is used, which might result in voice thickening, modest increases in body and facial hair without a complete halting of the menstrual cycle, allowing for reversibility.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
