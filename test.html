  <p>
    This page aims to be a resource to archive and index available factual information about all forms of Gender-affirming Hormone Therapy (GAHT). We hope that this resources can help mitigate the gatekeeping some care providers impose upon people seeking hormone therapy or some change in their regime, citing lack of research for treatment methods and specific medication.
