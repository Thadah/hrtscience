<h2><strong>Background</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Gender clinics are experiencing an increase in non-binary and/or genderqueer (NBGQ) individuals applying for gender affirming medical treatment (GAMT). GAMT is a well-established approach in reducing body dissatisfaction in binary transgender (BT) people, but knowledge on GAMT in NBGQ people is limited. Previous research shows that NBGQ individuals report different treatment needs compared to BT individuals. In attempting to address this difference, the current study examines the association between identifying as NBGQ, body dissatisfaction and their underlying motives for GAMT. The main research objectives were to describe the desires and motives for GAMT in NBGQ people and to examine how body dissatisfaction and gender identity relate to one’s request for GAMT.</p>
<h2><strong>Methods</strong></h2>
<p>Online self-report questionnaires were administered on 850 adults referred to a gender identity clinic (<i>Mdn</i> age = 23.9 years). Gender identity and desires for GAMT were surveyed at clinical entry. Body satisfaction was assessed with the Body Image Scale (BIS). Multiple linear regressions were used to examine whether BIS scores differed between NBGQ and BT individuals. Chi-square post hoc analyses were used to identify differences in treatment desires and motives between BT and NBGQ individuals. Logistic regressions were conducted to study the association between body image, gender identity and treatment desire.</p>
<h2><strong>Results</strong></h2>
<p>Compared to BT persons (<i>n</i> = 729), NBGQ persons (<i>n</i> = 121) reported less body dissatisfaction, primarily with the genital area. NBGQ persons also preferred fewer GAMT interventions. If a procedure was not desired, NBGQ individuals more often motivated this on the basis of their gender identity, while BT individuals more often cited the risks of the procedure as their primary reason. The study confirms the need for more NBGQ specialized care, as they have a distinct experience of their gender incongruence, physical distress and express specific needs in GAMT.</p>
