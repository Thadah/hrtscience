<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Although the 2017 Endocrine Society Guidelines for gender dysphoria stipulated that cross-sex hormone therapy (CHT) achieve gonadal steroid levels equivalent to those of a cisperson of the chosen sex, for transgender women (male-to-female gender dysphoria), current gonadal therapy is usually estradiol. Accumulated evidence indicates that normally ovulatory menstrual cycles are necessary for ciswomen’s current fertility, as well as for later-life bone and cardiovascular health and the prevention of breast and endometrial cancers.</p>
<h2>Evidence Acquisition</h2>
<p>Extensive past clinical experience with transgender women’s CHT using estradiol/estrogen combined with progesterone/medroxyprogesterone and pioneering the addition of spironolactone. Comprehensive progesterone physiology research plus a brief review of transgender women’s literature to assess current therapy and clinical outcomes, including morbidity and mortality.</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>To emphasize that both ovarian hormones, progesterone as well as estradiol, are theoretically and clinically important for optimal transgender women’s CHT.</p>
<h2>Evidence Synthesis</h2>
<p>It is important to add progesterone to estradiol and an antiandrogen in transgender women’s CHT. Progesterone may add the following: (i) more rapid feminization, (ii) decreased endogenous testosterone production, (iii) optimal breast maturation to Tanner stages 4/5, (iv) increased bone formation, (v) improved sleep and vasomotor symptom control, and (vi) cardiovascular health benefits.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Evidence has accrued that normal progesterone (and ovulation), as well as physiological estradiol levels, is necessary during ciswomen’s premenopausal menstrual cycles for current fertility and long-term health; transgender women deserve progesterone therapy and similar potential physiological benefits.</p>
